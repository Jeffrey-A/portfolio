This involves implementing foundational styles such as typography, icons, and layouts. As well as implementing components such as headers, footers, banners, and others. Then everything is put together, implementing fully functional templates. Furthermore, I implement content migration scripts using node.js to fix data issues and to migrate data from third party databases into RubyLaw data stores.

In addition, I implemented node.js scripts to export, transform, and import data. And I also performed WCAG 2.0 accessibility audits using Pa11y and resolved the errors found.
